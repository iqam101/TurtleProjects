# TurtleProjects
The turtle module in Python provides a fun and interactive way to create graphics and drawings using a virtual turtle. It is especially popular among beginners learning programming and computer graphics.
In this project i have coded a heart shape using turtle.
Many other shapes can be graphically displayed!
